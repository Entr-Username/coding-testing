  hey guysss I'm gonna make something as a way to alleviate the urge to go crazy and rant about the strange, eccentric, kooky, and obscure interests that I require<br>
  I'm gonna make a page thing online that will alleviate that thing and will substitute as an audience..? (??) I'm trying to say something but I can't find the words<br>

the span id thing gives the thing inside the <span> code an id, not refers to something with the id
document.getElementById().innerHTML basically selects that thing with the specified id yeah
